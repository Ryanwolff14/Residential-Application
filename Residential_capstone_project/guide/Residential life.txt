Project idea #8 {
			
					-Mobile Website for Residential Life

	
			What it does: 
					*	for Residential Life that would provide Res Life individuals the ability to check students into and out of dorm rooms
					(e.g., tracking existing damage) using a smart phone or tablet. Currently Res Life uses paper forms, requiring significant effort 
					in hand-entry of details and management of the forms during the year. This online website would alleviate much of that burden.
					*	the smart phone app would just be a mobile version of the site with the same features just more organized and compressed
					*	the ability to organize with a group on finding an apartment/duplex/or house to rent with them or for yourself
					*	Google maps integration for mapping out potential places to stay and when you found one finds routes for walking/driving
						-to a parking lot/garage
						-to your classes
						-to friends apartment/duplex/dorm ect
						-to the landlord if needed
					
			
			
			User Stories:
					as an admin i want to edit student info as in dorm rooms and student number
						-confirm damage for each dorm rooms 
						-see reports from students who requested a dorm change, damage report or complaints because then they cant be blamed if the student says they filled
								a report or not
					as a student(dorm) i want to edit your profile
						-when entering a dorm you fill out a forum on everything you notice about the dorm and damage
						-make requests for a new dorm
						-fill out forums to send to admins that have to do with damage reports complaints ect.
					as a student(residential) i want to be able to organize everything yourself or with a group because there are too many problems between roommates
								that have to do with miscommunication.
						-create a group list of potential places to stay because some places could be forgot about if they arnt written down or if one person finds a place 
								by chance and forgets to tell the others they can easily add it to the list when its found
						- when you find a place edit all the noticeable features (damage, rent amount, electronics, utilities)
						- give notifications to you or the group when rent is commming up
						- have an organized list of all the electronics or personal stuff that you want to keep track of
						- Google maps with all the closest places to get beer/alcohol
						- if a landlord has a profile for the place you could submit reports for moving in to confirm everything noticeable for the house
							*make damage reports.
					as a landlord i want to  view the status of your houses/places where students are staying 
						-confirm damage reports from tenants 
						-have a Google map with houses/places owned that show whether they are available or not viewable by potential tenants looking for places to stay
								because it will streamline the landlords ability to manage their houses
